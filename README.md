# Video Upload in Java

This project demonstrates a video upload feature implemented using Java and Spring Boot.

## Overview

The video upload system provides the following functionality:

1. **Video Upload**: Users can upload videos by sending a POST request to the `/videos` endpoint with the video file and a title.
2. **Video Retrieval**: Users can retrieve information about a specific video by sending a GET request to the `/videos/{id}` endpoint.

The project consists of the following main components:

- `VideoController`: Exposes the API endpoints for video upload and retrieval.
- `VideoService`: Handles the business logic for video upload and retrieval.
- `Video`: The entity representing a video.
- `VideoDTO`: A data transfer object for representing a video.
- `StorageService`: Handles the storage and retrieval of uploaded video files.
- `GlobalExceptionHandler`: Provides a centralized exception handling mechanism.
- `ErrorResponse`: A data transfer object for representing error responses.
- `ResourceNotFoundException`: A custom exception for handling cases where a video is not found.

## Usage

To use the video upload system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the application using the following command:
    
    ```
    ./gradlew bootRun
    
    ```
    
3. The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Uploading a Video

To upload a video, send a POST request to the `/videos` endpoint with the video file and a title in the request parameters:

```
POST /videos

```

Request Body:

```
{
  "file": <video_file>,
  "title": "My Video"
}

```

The server will respond with a `VideoDTO` representing the uploaded video.

### Retrieving a Video

To retrieve information about a specific video, send a GET request to the `/videos/{id}` endpoint:

```
GET /videos/{id}

```

The server will respond with a `VideoDTO` containing the video details.

## Security Considerations

This example focuses on the basic functionality of video upload and retrieval. In a production environment, you may want to consider the following security enhancements:

- Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to the video upload and retrieval features.
- Validate the uploaded video files to ensure they meet the required file type, size, and content restrictions.
- Integrate with a content delivery network (CDN) to efficiently serve the uploaded video files.
- Implement server-side video processing and transcoding to support multiple video formats and resolutions.
- Provide the ability to manage video metadata, such as descriptions, tags, and categories.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements that could be made to this project:

- Implement thumbnail generation for uploaded videos.
- Provide the ability to delete or update existing videos.
- Integrate with a video player library for seamless video playback within the application.
- Implement video sharing and collaboration features, allowing users to share videos with others.
- Provide analytics and reporting capabilities for video views, engagement, and user behavior.
- Explore the integration of machine learning or computer vision techniques for advanced video processing and analysis.
